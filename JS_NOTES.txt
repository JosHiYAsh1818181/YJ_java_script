JS IS PROGRAMING LANGUAGE.
JAVA-SCRIPT IS A DAYNAMICALLY TYPE PROGRAMING LANGUAGE MEANS WE CAN NOT DEFINED DATA TYPE FOR vairables ITS AUTOMATICALLY DEFINED 
-->we can use CODE EDITOR ( VS-CODE) BECAUSE IT IS FREE.WE CAN CODE EVRY LANGUAGES IN VS-CODE 

TOPIC:-VAIABLES & DATA TYPE
===========================
--->console.log("yash") "we can print a message to the console, console.log is print in every new line" 

****vairables****
-----------------
RULES:-
---> variables name are case sensitive;a & A is diffrent.
--->only letters , undersocre(_),digit and $ is allowed(not even space).
--->our variables first character is letter or undersocre or $ (digit are not valid name).
--->reserv word can not be use in vairables.
--->try to use camle-case to DEFINED variables (for good developer)
        fullName-->camle case --> use this type of case
        full-name-->kabab case
        full_name-->snak case
        FullName-->pascal case

****variables keywords****
--------------------------
three types:-let,const and var.
1.var --> it is a old method to declare a variable 
      --> we can declare same name and same value of our variables and same name and diffrent value of our vairables
2.let --> it is a block scope variable
      --> we can not declare second time to the same vairables but we can update same variable value 
    for exam:- false(
            let name="yash";
            let name="utsav";
    )
    for exam:- true(
            let name="yash joshi";
            name="utsav";
            "UPDATE THE SAME VAIABLES VALUE"
    )
    for exam:-true(
            {
                let name="yash";
                console.log(name);
            }

            {
                let name="utsav";
                console.log(name);
            }
    )
3.const ---> it is a block scope vairables
        ---> vairables cannot be re-declared or update in const .

----> vairables are container for data which is store data,"vari--means change"
use ("")<-- for strining 

****ASSIGNMENT OPERATOER****
----------------------------
FOR EXAM:- A=B <--- it means "b" value give to the "a".
